# Timelines-Technologies-Project

Does it really matter if the vast majority of
people work for basic incomes in a future
populated by autonomous technologies?

If autonomous technologies can eliminate all 
mundane work, then is it possible to refine
and/or replace current economic concepts with
new concepts that eliminate poverty and
wealth inequality?

Is the concept of a "Working Class" an 
outdated idea? Should the "Working Class"
transition to a "New Investing Class"?

A repository for documents and code for the Timelines Technologies Project.

Link to main supporting document which contains
some esoteric ideas as well as links to other
more practical documents and ideas.
